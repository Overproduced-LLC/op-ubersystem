    <p>
        Please join the line for at-door payments when you're ready to pay for and pick up your badge. Once you get near 
        the front of the line, keep an eye out for stations marked "Cash" or "Card" and make sure to go to a "Cash" station if you
        want to pay with cash.
        {% if qr_code_id %}You can show the check-in barcode below to the volunteer at the registration desk to quickly look up your pending
