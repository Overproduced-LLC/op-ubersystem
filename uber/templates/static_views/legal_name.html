<h3 align="center"> Name & ID Policy (Check-In, Privacy, and Administrative Use) </h3>

{{ c.EVENT_NAME }} is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment. To meet legal, safety, and logistical needs while protecting your privacy, we collect the following types of name information:

<br/> <br/>

<h3>1. Legal Name (As shown on Photo ID)</h3>
<p>
    Used <b>only</b> for internal verification at check-in and for bookings that legally require matching identification (e.g., air travel, lodging check-in with ID).
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only designated staff may view this name.</li>
    <li>It will never be shared or printed on public materials</li>
    <li>It is not used in day-to-day interactions</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Badge Name (Public-Facing Name)</h3>
<p>
    This is the name you'd like us to use for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your <b>event badge</b></li>
    <li>On-camera overlays and graphics</li>
    <li>Discord nickname and general communication</li>
    <li>Any printed or verbal recognition during the event</li>
</ul>
If your first and last names are <em>exactly</em> as they appear on your photo ID, you can simply check the box indicating this to skip filling in a separate name.

<h3>3. Administrative Name (Real name for Private Use)</h3>
<p>
    Used when a full or commonly used real name is necessary for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Travel or lodging bookings</b> where ID may not be required</li>
    <li><b>Emergency contact situations</b></li>
    <li>Other administrative tasks where your badge name may not be sufficient or recognizable</li>
</ul>
This may be different from your legal name and is not used publicly. Only authorized staff will access this, and it will never be shared or used on materials.

<br/> <br/>

<h2>Privacy Commitment</h2>

<ul>
    <li>All name information is treated with strict confidentiality</li>
    <li>Only the minimum necessary staff will see your Legal or Administrative Name.</li>
    <li>Your names will <b>never be shared across systems or with others</b> without your consent.</li>
</ul>

If you have questions or need accommodations, please reach out â€” we're here to support you.
