    {{ application.attendee.display_name }},<br/>
    This is to notify you that {{ member.attendee.display_name }} has just joined your room group "{{ application.room_group_name }}".
    This brings the total number of group members, including yourself, to {{ application.group_members|length + 1 }}{% if application.group_members|length == 3 %} -- the total number of members you can have in a group{% endif %}.
</p>
<p>
    If this is not someone you expected to join, you can remove them from the group on your <a href="{{ c.URL_BASE }}/hotel_lottery/room_group?id={{ application.id }}" target="_blank">room group management page</a>.
